## About The Project
### Hackathon
We are participating from the 14th to the 16th of October 2022 at the VIScon Hackathon.
Here we will have the opportunity to compete against your fellow students in a Hackathon.
The Hackathon is a 42-hour event where you will work in teams to develop a solution to a given problem.

### Our Task
The task is to create a web application that allows students to review and comment on courses.

#### Prompt
The knowledge of the older students is essential in the selection of courses If only there were a place where all the
tips and information about the upcoming courses could be found. Sometimes the information on the VVZ is not helpful and
you ask other students what they have heard about this course or whether they have taken it. Build a platform so that
students can exchange information about courses at ETH.

#### Requirements
- Users should be able to review different aspects of the course.
- Prevent anyone from being bullied or harassed.
- All courses from the vvz should be visible.
- The user should be able to filter or search for suitable courses.
   - Filter review categories
   - Filter courses by semester

### Optional Enhancements
- Recommendation system for students (you liked this course, maybe you also will like that one)
- Take the data from the course surveys (HoPo)
- Users can create tags like "no script" etc.
